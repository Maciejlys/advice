# Advice

A very small project project you can visit [here](https://deft-croquembouche-edc440.netlify.app/) <br>
The point of this was to have some fun with [SignalStore](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals/signal-store) <br>
and take a look on how to test it (which turned out to be easy) and create custom features <br>
that can be reused across the application, like the one here that can be attached to every store that have a request in it. <br>
It was fun, the signal store works amazing, have a great feel to it and it was a pleasure to do. <br>
Definitely gonna use this in my feature projects!
