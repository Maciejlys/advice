# Advice

A very small project project you can visit [here](https://deft-croquembouche-edc440.netlify.app/)
The point of this was to have some fun with [SignalStore](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals/signal-store)
and take a look on how to test it (which turned out to be easy) and create custom features
that can be reused across the application, like the one here that can be attached to every store that have a request in it.
It was fun, the signal store works amazing, have a great feel to it and it was a pleasure to do.
Definitely gonna use this in my feature projects!
