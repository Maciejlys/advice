# Advice

A very small project you can visit [here](https://deft-croquembouche-edc440.netlify.app/) <br>
UX and idea for this small project was taken from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)

# Why

The point of this was to have some fun with [SignalStore](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals/signal-store) <br>
and take a look at how to test it (which turned out to be easy) and create custom features <br>
that can be reused across the application, like the one here that can be attached to every store <br>
that have a request in it so that you can track the state of the request. <br>

code that I am talking about can be found [here](https://github.com/Maciejlys/advice/tree/main/src/app/shared/data-access)

# Conclusion

It was fun, the signal store works like a charm, have a great feel to it and it was a pleasure to work with. <br>
Definitely gonna use this in my feature projects!
